        <p>I have a love for good quotes and strong meanings, while also being excited and knowledgable of the fact that people find infinite, particular meanings behind them. I have always felt that a key meaning of life is opening oneself up to interpretation. Being open and learning about whatâ€™s swirling in the minds of people around us shows that we are not all so different. Your experiences in life have a way of shining through in the opinions you make and in the way you react to a piece of work. Art and music bring innovation and shared expression to a world that often needs more unity.</p>
        
        <p>Painting is the form of artistry I engage in the most myself. But if I am not painting for inspiration, I am most likely starting a new show or movie to become enthralled in. I have always had this fascination with powerful, beautiful women and that definitely shows through in my art. Whether it is painting a woman in turmoil or one with a smile on her face, I am able to express my individuality through each and every one of them. painting helps me muddle through all the feelings that come over me and I think it does the same for so many others.</p>
        
        <p>Powerful pieces of art also include great television shows and movies. Television and film that is great makes you feel, and it makes you think. I do not think I am alone when I say I think we may internally compare the same heartbreak we see occur on our tv screens, with our own. There are so many programs out there that we regard as mindless watches, somethings to just laugh at and not stress yourself out over. But there are also those movies and TV shows that make you think a step further, make you feel an overwhelming emotion, and that combat so much with our own modern lives that we cannot help but to reflect.</p>
