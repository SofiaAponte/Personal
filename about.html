        <h1>About Sofia</h1>
        <img src="profilephotoB.jpg" width="50%" align="left"> 
        <p>I am currently a student at Texas State University, studying Digital Media Innovation and Mass Communication. I am excited to be the first person in my family to graduate from college, but I would have never been able to get this far in my life without art and music to console and empower myself at times. Art has a way of helping people better understand what is going on in our own lives. It can take us to a whole other world when we find ourselves too overwhelmed with this one. My two favorite hobbies are binging a new show on a streaming channel or painting faces that inspire me.</p>
        
        <p>One of my favorite pieces of art in particular, is a movie I have loved ever since it found me. That movie is called Life Itself, produced by Amazon Prime Video and starring Olivia Wilde and Oscar Isaac. Life Itself portrays just how much love means in the great scheme of things. After all, life truly is all about the choices and the connections we make in life while learning how to be and what makes us happy. If you want to understand me a little more and watch a movie that speaks to my heart, go check out Life Itself.</p>
        
        <p>My family helped teach me at an early age how important music is for your well-being. Music shows you just how deeply you can feel or it can help you escape. When I went through terrible heartbreak which I felt no one could fully understand, I found music that proved me wrong and was able to start a new chapter. And when I am excited beyond words- I have a playlist for that too. I hope you can journey into this new, creative chapter with me.</p>
