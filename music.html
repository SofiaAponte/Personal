        <p>Indie music has come to be my favorite music genre growing up. Arctic Monkeys, Cage the Elephant, and Two Door Cinema Club are bands that grew as I grew. Music gives me confidence: the confidence that I am not going through what I am going through alone and the confidence to take risks throughout my life. Lyrics are just as important as the sounds an artist creates, and they are what makes people feel unified. Shared experiences and shared expression is what this life is about, so share the art and music that inspires you- you are not the only one who may need to hear it.</p>
        
        <p>Indie music began as an underground punk-rock scene where artists independent of record labels could play their music and feel like they belonged. It started as a genre for growing adolescents who valued something that could not be controlled. The sounds of Indie artists have changed over time. Today it may sound completely different, but the reason people listen and engage with it still has not changed. When a group of people can get together and relate with one another in a creative space, magic happens.</p>
        
        <p>A song can have one single sentence that you find beautiful beyond capacity, and it stays with you forever. You can feel like a fool for having fell in love, and there are songs that will agree with you. But another song may show you that experiencing situations like heartbreak only make you more insightful and intentional moving forward. Changing Of The Seasons by Two Door Cinema Club has been one of my very favorite songs for a long time and I want to share it with you for one reason. Time goes by, we grow and we transform, and as the seasons change, we find that we have too.</p>
